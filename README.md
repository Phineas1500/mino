# min() - AI-Powered Video Learning Optimization

Tired of sitting through long videos? min() uses AI to optimize your learning experience by analyzing and adjusting video content intelligently.

## Inspiration

In today's digital learning environment, video lectures are a primary source of education. However, traditional video playback methods are inefficient - you either watch at a fixed speed or risk missing important content by manually skipping. We created min() to solve this problem by using AI to analyze lecture content and create a personalized, optimized learning experience.

## What it does

Picture this: Instead of trudging through lectures at a fixed pace, min() analyzes your content using GPT-3.5 and creates a personalized viewing experience that's as unique as your learning style. By dynamically adjusting playback speeds between 1x and 2.5x based on content importance, our smart system trims your watching time by an average of 30-40% while keeping comprehension intact. But that's just the beginning! min() goes above and beyond by automatically generating study materials, including summaries, flashcards, and an interactive transcript that highlights the most crucial concepts.

min() transforms how you consume educational videos:
- Uses GPT-3.5 to analyze lecture content and identify key concepts
- Dynamically adjusts video playback speed based on content importance (1x-2.5x)
- Generates comprehensive study materials automatically:
  - Content summaries
  - Key learning points
  - Auto-generated flashcards
  - Interactive transcript with importance scoring
- Shows real-time analytics of time saved and content optimization
- "Turbo mode" that intelligently varies playback speed while preserving crucial information
